# Asha Health: AI-Powered Symptom Checker

Asha Health is a web application designed to serve as a personal AI health assistant. It empowers users to input their health symptoms and receive an initial analysis, educational guidance, and an assessment of urgency. The app leverages the power of Google's Gemini AI to provide intelligent, helpful, and easy-to-understand health information.
